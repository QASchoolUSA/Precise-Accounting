## Logo Design Feedback
Change the current logo design. It looks like those sketchy American sites from the 2000s. Just put the company name there. Is it really important for the header to say the exact same thing as the URL? 

## Contact Page Form
Add a fillable form to the Contact page that triggers an email to me. Need to minimize calls so I don't waste time figuring out situations over the phone, then they ghost after I quote the price. Easier to get the request and send them a questionnaire based on it. You know those forms—name, phone, email. Add business name (optional) and first question: service they're interested in, via dropdown listing all my services.

## Consultation Page Issue
On the consultation page, when checking "I have read and agree" and clicking "proceed to payment," it shows a window but nothing else happens.

## Personal Tax Page Layout
On the Personal Tax page, move the button block higher so users don't have to scroll through all the text to take action.

## Schedule Consultation Inconsistency
"Schedule a Consultation" doesn't work consistently across pages. Some go straight to cal.com, others to my Contact page. Make it always go through Contact (has Agree checkboxes), though you said checkboxes aren't needed since terms cover it somewhere. Anyway, make it consistent everywhere. Also update prices and options to match the Contact page. Where it shows "estimate," add "partial payment" phrase—unclear why one price shows here but $200 on next step.

## Bookkeeping & Tax Prep Estimates
For Bookkeeping Estimate, replace "Schedule a Consultation" with "Send My Request." Then they fill name/contact details, Submit sends me email with all their answers so I can respond and clarify details. Don't want answers lost on site. Same for Tax Prep Estimate—replace "Contact Us" with "Send My Request," same form and email trigger.

## Business Tax Page
Duplicate content—keep only the first version. On Business Tax page.

## List Alignment Fix
Align this list to the left edge please.
