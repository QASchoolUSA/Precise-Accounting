### Meet the Owner, Lana Korentsova
I bring over a decade of experience in finance and accounting, supported by a Master's degree in Mathematics and Statistics, giving me a strong analytical edge in everything I do.[1]

My career began in Russia as a bank economist, analyzing businesses for lending and investment decisions, a role that shaped my analytical approach and attention to detail. After moving to the U.S., I continued my work as an accountant in the trucking industry, one of the most complex areas of small business finance. This blend of financial analysis and U.S. accounting experience allows me to offer a deeper, more comprehensive understanding of each client's financial situation.

I'm also an IRS Annual Filing Season Program (AFSP) credentialed tax professional, committed to continuous learning and staying fully up to date with the changing tax landscape. Every recommendation I make is rooted in legal, compliant, and ethical tax-reduction strategies.

- **Estimated Tax**  
  The IRS requires self-employed taxpayers and business owners to pay taxes quarterly, not just once a year (typically April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15). Falling behind or underpaying can result in penalties and interest.  
  We know these calculations can be tricky, so we determine accurate quarterly amounts for you and guide you through the schedule.

### Tax Optimization & Financial Planning
When tax season arrives, there are usually only a few limited things we can still do to legally reduce your tax liability. Effective tax strategy is built on proactive planning, not last-minute fixes. That applies to both personal and business taxes. Take action now, while the options are open and the impact is meaningful.[1]

**Let's build a proactive strategy that truly works for you!**
