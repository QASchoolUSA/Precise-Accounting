Your life isn’t one-size-fits-all - and your tax return shouldn’t be either. We take time to
understand the full picture of your income, deductions, credits, and personal circumstances so
nothing gets overlooked. Whether you're a W-2 employee, self-employed, a homeowner, a
freelancer, a non-resident, or have investment and rental income - we tailor your return to
ensure every lawful benefit is used to your advantage.
Many taxpayers accidentally overpay or expose themselves to risk by filing alone. We protect
you from IRS issues and help you avoid missing out on valuable tax savings you are entitled to.
With Precise Accounting by your side, you gain clarity, confidence, and peace of mind - every
step of the way.
We also specialize in working with immigrants from post-USSR countries — including
Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and others. We understand the unique tax
situations involving foreign income, ITIN, visa status, U.S. tax residency rules, and
new-to-the-system taxpayers. We provide explanations in simple language and help navigate
the U.S. tax system with confidence.
We proudly serve clients locally in Central Florida including Orlando, Kissimmee, Lake Nona,
Winter Garden, Windermere, Altamonte Springs, Sanford,
— and remotely across Florida and
other states. With secure digital tools, expert support is always within reach, no matter where
you live or move.
Whether you need help with IRS notices, education credits, child tax benefits, rental
property reporting, gig-work, or international tax considerations, we make the process smooth,
organized, and stress-free.

We provide corporate and partnership tax preparation for LLCs, S-Corps, C-Corps, and sole
proprietors across Florida and other states. From trucking companies, Amazon and other
e-commerce sellers to service-based businesses, we ensure full compliance with IRS and state
requirements while optimizing your tax outcome.
Growing a business requires strong financial decisions, and taxes are one of the most impactful.
We go far beyond simply filing a return. We analyze your bookkeeping, entity structure,
deduction opportunities, prior-year filings, compliance requirements, and industry-specific rules
to ensure your company keeps more of its hard-earned money.
From S-Corps and C-Corps to partnerships and single-member LLCs, we help Florida business
owners legally reduce tax liability and stay fully aligned with federal and state regulations. You’ll
always know what to expect, what to prepare for, and how your taxes impact your future growth.

## Estimated Tax
The IRS requires self-employed taxpayers and business owners to pay taxes quarterly, not just
once a year (typically April 15, June 15, September 15, and January 15). Falling behind or
underpaying can result in penalties and interest.
We know these calculations can be tricky, so we determine accurate quarterly amounts for you
and guide you through the schedule.

Quarterly taxes can be confusing, especially when income fluctuates. Instead of guessing and
risking penalties, we calculate precise payment amounts based on your income trends,
business projections, and tax law changes.
We help you plan your cash flow through the year, avoid unwanted IRS letters, and stay ahead
of deadlines. With us, estimated taxes become predictable and manageable, helping you feel
prepared instead of stressed.
We calculate and file estimated tax payments for freelancers, real estate investors,
gig-workers, self-employed individuals and business owners making sure you're always ahead
of deadlines.

## Tax Optimization & Planning
When tax season arrives, there are usually only a few limited things we can still do to legally
reduce your tax liability. Effective tax strategy is built on proactive planning, not last-minute
fixes. That applies to both personal and business taxes. Take action now, while the options are
open and the impact is meaningful.
Let’s build a proactive strategy that truly works for you!

A great tax result doesn’t happen once a year, it’s the product of decisions made all year long.
We review how your personal and business finances interact and create a strategy tailored to
your goals: retirement savings, childcare costs, real estate, legal structure, and more.
We identify where opportunities exist, and show you how to take action before deadlines close
the door. The earlier we start planning, the more you save and the stronger your long-term
financial picture becomes.
